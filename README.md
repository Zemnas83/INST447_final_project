Dataset Description

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wsj/college-salaries 

This dataset provides data to help show whether the college and major one pursues is profitable in their future careers. It contains three sub-datasets based on degree, college type, and college region. For the purposes of this project, we may opt to combine the ‘salaries-by-college-type’ and ‘salaries-by-region’, as they are very similar except for a singular column. In each table, there are corresponding starting career salaries as well as mid-career salaries including percentiles. In this dataset, it can be assumed that ‘mid-career’ is considered 10 years post-grad.
